## Description
I ended up completely rebuidling this portfolio site form the ground up to make sure that it had fully response, mobile-first design, better UX, a less-distracting background, and a host of other changes. Of course I also upgraded it from handlebars to React, although it is powered by the same MySQL database as before.

## Installation Instructions
In the same directory as package.json, type ```npm install``` and then ``npm start``
You will also need to set up a mySQL database for this.
## Exciting Trivia
The background image is one of Harold Fisk's maps of the banks of the Mississippi river. The are unique and delightful, because they are maps of space but also of time--Fisk charted the ever-changing course of the river through the seasons.
